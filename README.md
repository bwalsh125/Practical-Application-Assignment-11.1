Assignment using CRISP-DM to examine used car data and provide insights into pricing.

I spent most of the time examining the data.  One crucial thing I neglected was outliers in the price categories.  This had a huge impact on results once removed.

The results were as expected.  Newer bigger trucks and sports cars will fetch higher prices while compact 4-cylinder sedans will sell at a dicount.

Other areas of study could include partiitoning the model's and manufacturers or a study by state.  For example, New York did show up in one model as a negative influence on pricing and Porche type models are more expensive.

I found it interesting that the data models back-up what we already know about the used car market.
